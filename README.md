# Web_Scraping_Python_BeautifulSoup
The goal of this project is to extract data from a website using web scraping techniques with Python and BeautifulSoup. 
Web scraping is a technique used to extract large amounts of data from websites. Web scraping is also known as web harvesting, web data extraction or screen scraping. The data is extracted from the websites and saved to a local file in the computer. This is most commonly done by writing an automated program. The program queries a web server, requests data (in the form of html and other files) and then parses that data to extract the required information. Web scraping encompasses a wide variety of programming techniques and technologies. The examples include data analysis, natural language parsing and information security.

Most of the websites can only be viewed using a web browser. They do not offer the functionality to save a copy of this data for personal use. The only option then is to manually copy and paste the data. It is a very tedious job which can take many hours to complete. Web Scraping is the technique of automating this process. Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page. Once fetched, then extraction can take place.
